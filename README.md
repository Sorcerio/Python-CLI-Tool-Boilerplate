# Python CLI Tools Boilerplate Template

> Version 2.0.0

Python Boiler Plate is a module boilerplate with built-in CLI tool support using `argparse`.

## Setup

This repository assumes you are using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python package manager.

To configure the boilerplate for your project follow these instructions:

1. To run the boilerplate setup wizard run: `uv run setupBoilerplate.py`
    * Note that running this *will delete this README file* from the local repository.
1. Delete the [setupBoilerplate.py](./setupBoilerplate.py) file.
1. Configure [config.toml](./config.toml) and [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) as needed.

The boilerplate is now setup and ready for development.
